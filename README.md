## Servus 👋

Hi there! I'm F13, an aspiring IT specialist for application development with a passion for everything to do with programming and technology. I love implementing new projects on Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and ESP32, and I'm constantly expanding my skills in Python, C#, .NET MAUI, and microcontroller programming.

I enjoy working on small gadgets, automation, and app development, as well as trying out new technologies.

My first public project was a software for a streamdeck I initially build with a friend of mine.
